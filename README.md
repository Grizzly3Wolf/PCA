# Implementing PCA

The aim of this project is to reduce the number of features for training the model using PCA .

A SVM classifier is used to classify particles into gamma(signal) or hadrons(background).

Results:
Number of Original Data Features: 10
Score for model with 2 original features: 0.7192926557272582
Score for model with 2 PCA features: 0.7417556157400031
